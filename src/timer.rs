//! ggez does not try to do any framerate limitation by default. If
//! you want to run at anything other than full-bore max speed all the
//! time, call [`thread::yield_now()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/fn.yield_now.html)
//! (or [`timer::yield_now()`](fn.yield_now.html) which does the same
//! thing) to yield to the OS so it has a chance to breathe before continuing
//! with your game. This should prevent it from using 100% CPU as much unless it
//! really needs to.  Enabling vsync by setting
//! [`conf.window_setup.vsync`](../conf/struct.WindowSetup.html#structfield.vsync)
//! in your [`Conf`](../conf/struct.Conf.html) object is generally the best
//! way to cap your displayed framerate.
